# Amazon's Bonus Prize For Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon

My submission for the Amazon Bonus Grant 2021

I am submitting two projects to this grant. The first is a bundle of my Tezos hackaton submissions - they offer potential value from the managed blockchain services on Ethereum. Second, I am submitting my Uniswap project because it aligns with Amazon's potential future. 

Both the Tezos bundle & Uniswap project have mass opportunity to have future use for an AMB node and/or AWS credits.

Submissions are in separate branches of this repository 

Thank you!
